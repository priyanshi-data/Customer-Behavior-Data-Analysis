📊 Retail Strategic Analysis & Consumer Insights
📌 Project Overview
As a final-year Economics (Hons) student at Delhi University, I developed this project to solve real-world business challenges. I transformed raw consumer data into actionable intelligence, focusing on market segmentation, logistics efficiency, and product quality.

🛠️ Multi-Disciplinary Tech Stack
Data Engineering: Python 3.12 (Pandas).
Business Intelligence & Querying: SQL (Advanced filtering, Aggregations, and Joins).
Statistical Visualization: Matplotlib & Seaborn.
Analysis Environment: Visual Studio Code / Jupyter.

⚙️ Phase 1: Data Engineering (Python)
I used Python to audit and clean the dataset, focusing on factual accuracy and integrity—key for Quality Analyst roles.

Missing Value Imputation: Identified missing review ratings and filled them using the median rating per product category to ensure data integrity.

Dataset Optimization: Identified and removed redundant features like promo codes and duplicate discount columns to streamline the analysis.

Standardization: Converted all headers into a clean snake_case format for better system compatibility and SQL-readiness.

Feature Engineering: Developed an age_group classification to allow for targeted demographic and behavior analysis.

⚙️ Phase 2: Strategic Business Intelligence (SQL)
I wrote five core SQL queries to extract deep business insights for Market Research and Business Analyst roles:

Revenue Attribution: Identified which gender and age groups drive the highest total revenue.

Product Performance: Ranked the Top 5 products based on customer feedback and satisfaction scores.

Logistics Analysis: Compared "Standard" vs. "Express" shipping to determine if premium services lead to higher customer spend.

Subscription Value: Measured the revenue impact of subscribers versus non-subscribers to evaluate loyalty programs.

Demographic Spend: Pinpointed the age bracket contributing the highest sales volume for market forecasting.

⚠️ Phase 3: Technical Troubleshooting & Adaptability
This project demonstrates my ability to solve technical problems and adapt to constraints.

Pivot to Python Visualization: While I initially planned to use Power BI, I encountered system installation issues on my current hardware. I successfully pivoted to Python-based reporting, proving my ability to build custom analytical dashboards from scratch.

Debugging: Resolved a critical ValueError in the reporting pipeline by re-aligning script variables with my standardized data headers.

Environment Management: Configured a professional analytics environment on Windows 10, managing all library dependencies manually.

📈 Phase 4: Key Results & Insights

Primary Demographic: Young Adults were identified as the highest revenue-generating segment.

Shipping Efficiency: Analysis proved that Express Shipping customers have a significantly higher average spend, justifying an expansion of premium logistics.

Stability vs. Volume: Data showed that while non-subscribers provide sales volume, subscribers provide the consistent revenue stability needed for long-term forecasting.
